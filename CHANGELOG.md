# Changelog


All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). This project follows the versions of [SMASH](https://github.com/smash-transport/smash), that means that each new version of SMASH triggers a new version of this project, in order to assure compatibility.
This changelog is in place since version SMASH-hadron-sampler-3.0.

The major categories to group changes in this log are:

* `Input / Output` for all, in particular breaking, changes, fixes and additions to the in- and output files.
* `Added` for new features.
* `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
* `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
* `Removed` for now removed features.

Also possible, but for this project less relevant, is `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
